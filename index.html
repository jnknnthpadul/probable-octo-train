  <h2>Underground River, Palawan</h2>
  <p>
    The gateway to Philippine’s Last Frontier, Palawan, is its capital Puerto Princesa. It is here that you can find the world’s longest navigable underground river and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Puerto Princesa Underground River or the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park.
    Paddleboats of the Puerto Princesa underground river tour cruise through scenic limestone cliffs as it makes its way through the 1.5-kilometer underground river cave.
    The park is also teeming with wildlife like crab-eating monkeys, monitor lizards, and bats. Island hopping escapades in Honda Bay and a visit to the Crocodile Farm are also highly recommended among the many things to do in Puerto Princesa.

  <h2>Banaue Rice Terraces, Ifugao</h2>
  <p>
    Hand-chiseled some 2000 years ago, the Banaue Rice Terraces in Banaue of Ifugao, North Luzon is a remarkable destination and is truly one of the most beautiful places in the Philippines.
    Sit atop a colorful jeepney as it cruises along winding roads in Banaue and views of dramatic mud-walled rice terraces leave you in awe.
    The Ifugao people were highly skilled in carving both wood and mountainsides. The Banaue Rice Terraces is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it offers spectacular views of emerald hues during the rice-growing seasons of April-May and October-November.
    Banaue may pack a lot of tourists so you can make your way further to quieter Batad Rice Terraces and take a quick dip at its mighty Tappiya waterfalls. You can also explore nearby Baguio City or pick fresh strawberries in La Trinidad, Benguet.

  <h2>White Beach, Boracay</h2>
  <p>
    Long hailed as one of the best beaches in the entire world, Boracay’s claim to fame is its 4-kilometer stretch of pure white, powdery sand called White Beach.
    Cliche as it sounds, but White Beach is truly postcard-perfect, with tall coconut trees lined up and crystal-clear calm waters rounding up its unmatched beauty making it a top attraction in Boracay trips.
    Its prominence in global publications has drawn in an influx of tourists over the last decades and there is no shortage of hotels, restaurants, and bars in the entire island

  <h2>Mayon Volacano, Legazpi</h2>
  <p>
    As soon as your flight lands at the airport in Legazpi City, the world’s most perfect cone and the most active volcano in the Philippines greets you with its majesty. Mayon Volcano is one of the most beautiful places to visit in the Philippines and is a top attraction in tours of Bicol region.
    Its sheer beauty (the name Mayon comes from the Bicolano word ‘magayon’ which means beautiful) hides a violent core, with past eruptions that flattened several towns.
    It is already a wonderful experience seeing the volcano from afar. But if you are an adrenaline junkie, you can soak up all its beauty while gliding through a zipline in Lignon Hill. Visit the Cagsawa Ruins, another viewing point of the Mayon Volcano.
    While in Legazpi, take a side trip to Donsol, where you can see whale sharks peacefully basking in their natural habitat.

  <h2>Nacpan Beach, El Nido</h2>
  <p>
    As if the lagoons and beaches of El Nido in Palawan is most famous for its paradise-like islands and lagoons but a 45-minute ride away through a land tour from its main town takes you to another idyllic destination: Nacpan Beach.
    Island hopping escapades in El Nido cannot be missed but after a jam-packed day of visiting coves, white-sand beach pockets, limestone cliffs, a trip to Nacpan Beach is still highly recommended and deserves a spot in your itinerary of things to see and do in El Nido.
    The main attraction here is its 4-kilometer shoreline with golden sand and endless palm trees lining up, perfect for just bumming around. Calitang Beach sits on the other side, and the two form what is now popularly known as the Twin Beaches of El Nido.
    Visitors are not advised to swim far away from shore in Nacpan as currents tend to become strong and rough with little warning.

  <h2>Calle Crisologo, Vigan</h2>
  <p>
    Travel back in time as you stroll along the streets of Calle Crisologo in Vigan. This 16th-century town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, quietly boasts of old-world charm and Spanish colonial architecture and is the top attraction in Vigan, Ilocos tours.
    The town has successfully managed to preserve the historic district where you can still find calesas (horse-drawn carriages). Sample the famous and delicious Ilocos empanada, and walk along cobbled streets lined up with souvenir shops selling pottery and Abel Iloko weaves, among the many things to see and do when in Vigan.
    The best time to visit for Calle Crisologo excursions is during the first week of May when the town celebrates the Vigan Festival of the Arts.
